# MorseCode

This is a Morse Code Translator mainly utilizing a binary search tree and a stack. The translator allows users to convert both from morse to English
and from English to morse.

Note: The Code in MorseCode.java is borrowed from my professor at Cal Poly, Paul Hatalsky. Its only pertinent information is the actual dictionary for
the conversions between English and morse.
